# davinci-eight a.k.a EIGHT

DaVinci EIGHT is a WebGL library for mathematical physics using Geometric Algebra

EIGHT is designed and developed according to the following principles:

1. Designed foremost to integrate with Mathematical Physics and Geometric Algebra.
2. Manage shader complexity rather than trying to hide it.
3. Be un-opinionated.
4. Assist with management of WebGL state and invariants.
5. Assist with GLSL boilerplate.
6. Assist with long running interactions, resource sharing and context management.
7. Provide reusable geometry abstractions on top of the core for productivity.
8. Provide smart shader program builders for productivity.
9. Facilitate use for research programming, education and demonstration.
10. Explicit is better than implicit.

## Why EIGHT?

8 = 2 * 2 * 2, which is the number of dimensions in a geometric space over a vector space of 3 dimensions.

Geometric Algebra is what you get when you define an associative multiplicative product for vectors.

More simply, 3D geometry is simpler when it is done using Geometric Algebra!

WARNING. This library is under active development; the API is subject to changes that are likely to break semantic versioning.
